```
6. Answer:
```{r}
Dates=str_match(nhl1415[gamerows],'class="skedStartDateSite">(.*?)</div>')
date=Dates[,2]
date[1:10]
```
7. Answer:
Away team:
```{r}
away.pattern='Away.*javascript:void\\(0\\);">(.*?)</a>.*?Home'
away.team=str_match(nhl1415[gamerows],away.pattern)
away=away.team[,2]
away[1:10]
```
Home team:
```{r}
Home.pattern='Home.*javascript:void\\(0\\);">(.*?)</a>.*?Time'
Home.team=str_match(nhl1415[gamerows],Home.pattern)
Home=Home.team[,2]
Home[1:10]
```
8. Answer: 
```{r}
time.pattern='skedStartTimeEST">(.*?)</div>'

Answer: I am a little confused with this problem. In part 4, it mentions that the goal is to extract the URL for buying ticket. However, the URL for the **TICKET>** button is not for purchasing tickets. Actully, the **BUY/SELL** button is for buying tickets. In this question, I identify these two URL because I am not sure which the right one is.

The URL for the **TICKET>** button:
```{r}
URLgamerows=c(gamerows[2:1230], gamerows[1230]+2)
URL.pattern1='href=\"(.*?)"><span>TICKETS'
URL1=str_match(nhl1415[URLgamerows],URL.pattern1)
T.URL=URL1[,2]
length(T.URL)
T.URL[1:5]
```
The URL for purchasing ticket should be the **BUY/SELL** button:
```{r}
URL.pattern2='TICKETSâ€º</span></a><a class="btn" shape="rect" href=\"(.*)"><span>BUY/SELL'
URL2=str_match(nhl1415[URLgamerows],URL.pattern2)
B.URL=URL2[,2]
length(B.URL)
B.URL[1:5]
```
For the URL for purchasing ticket button, most links have the home team in it.

10.Answer:
```{r}
df=data.frame(date, away, Home, Time, B.URL)
df[1221:1230,]
```
